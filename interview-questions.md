# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer:

JSX is a format within react that combines html and javascript. HTML and JSX are different because HTML doesn't render any logic. One syntax difference between the two is that you need fragments "<> </>" within the return to show that you are returning something in JSX.


Researched answer:

JSX is a special syntax that combines javaScript and HTML
you use curly braces to use variables in jsx (within fragments)
react doesn't require jsx, but it is considered useful
syntax differences: className instead of class

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: 

Yarn stands for yet another resource negotiator, it is a package manager, and runs dependencies. You use it for tests, and looks for errors in the code.

Researched answer: Yarn stands for yet another resource negotiator, it is a package manager, and runs dependencies. You use it for tests, and looks for errors in the code. I believe the files that are modified in react are yarn.lock and package.json.

3. What is a React component?


Your answer: A component is the child to the parent that is App.js. There are logic components, and display components. The log lies in the app.js, while the child components are usually calling back on variables in the app.js and used as display components.


Researched answer: There are logic components, and display components. The log lies in the app.js, while the child components are usually calling back on variables in the app.js and used as display components. You can reuse components and make them dynamic using state.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are stored in the app.js while props are passed down onto the children component.

State values are values that need to be updated or changed. props are a way to communicate between components where you can pass down state values and display data. Props are a way to reference data, and must be invoked with a component call.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div is used to represent a certain part of a webpage.

Researched answer: A div is used to represent a certain part of a webpage. This is a block level tag. Span is an inline tag. You can use this to group elements. They are very similar to each other.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: 

This is a paradigm that deals with complexity of programs, a need for containers for data that can be changed without impacting crucial parts of a program.

2. Ruby: 

Ruby is an object oriented language. It uses objects to contain data, and behavior. Variables, and functions are able to be stored and attached to the object. 

3. Implicit return: An implicit return is when there isn't a return specified for that input, the last line of the method will be returned automatically. 

4. Ruby blocks: A ruby block is passed to a method in the form of an anoymous function to determine the outcome of something. They are usually definied with keywords "do" and "end". There are a variety of methods that can be used within ruby blocks

5. Ruby hashes: A ruby hash conatins unique keys as well as their values. You can perform 4 different actions on a ruby hash. The acronym is called CRUD, you can create, read, update, or delete a ruby hash.
